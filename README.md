# FlowSynx Plugin Registry

The FlowSynx Plugin Registry is a comprehensive platform built with .NET 9 and Blazor, designed to facilitate the management, discovery, and integration of plugins within the FlowSynx ecosystem. By providing a centralized registry, it enables organizations and developers to easily register, browse, and manage plugins, ensuring seamless interoperability and extensibility across FlowSynx services.

This solution leverages a modular architecture, separating core domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns to promote maintainability and scalability.
